# 📊 Excel Word Completion & Autocorrect LSP Server

**A local Python-based Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for intelligent word completion and autocorrect in Excel, integrated using `xlwings`.** This project provides real-time word suggestions and autocorrect functionalities directly in Excel cells, with a roadmap for advanced NLP and UI features.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Word Completion** — Intelligent suggestions for partial words typed in Excel.
- ✅ **Autocorrect** — Basic autocorrect functionality using `textblob`.
- ✅ **Local LSP Server** — Lightweight and fast, built using `pygls`.
- ✅ **Excel Integration** — Seamlessly connects Excel to the LSP server via `xlwings`.
- ✅ **Easy Setup** — Minimal dependencies and simple architecture.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/excel-lsp-autocomplete.git
   cd excel-lsp-autocomplete
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the LSP server:**
   ```bash
   python lsp_server.py
   ```

5. **Open the Excel example file:**
   - Navigate to the `examples/` folder.
   - Open `example.xlsx` with macros enabled.
   - Run the macro to test word completion.

---

## 📋 Usage

1. **Type in cell A1** in the example Excel file.
2. **Run the macro** (via `xlwings`) to trigger word completion.
3. Suggested completions will appear in **cell B1**.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 🧠 **Advanced NLP Integration**:
  - Use models like BERT or GPT for smarter, context-aware completions.

- ⚡ **Real-time Suggestions**:
  - Implement WebSocket-based communication for live word suggestions as users type.

- 🛡️ **Enhanced Autocorrect**:
  - Integrate `symspellpy` for high-speed autocorrect with large dictionaries.

- 🎨 **Improved UI in Excel**:
  - Add dropdowns or suggestion lists directly in Excel cells using VBA forms or Data Validation.

- 📈 **Contextual Awareness**:
  - Analyze previous cells' data to provide more relevant suggestions.
